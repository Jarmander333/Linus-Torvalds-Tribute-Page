    <p>Linus Benedict Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator, and the principal developer of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel for GNU/Linux operating systems (distributions) and other operating systems such as Android and Chrome OS. He also created the distributed version control system Git.</p>
    <p>As of 2006, approximately two percent of the Linux kernel was written by Torvalds himself.  Because thousands have contributed to the Linux kernel, this percentage is one of the largest contributions to it.  However, he stated in 2012 that his own personal contribution is now mostly merging code written by others, with little programming.  Torvalds has the highest authority to decide which new code is incorporated into the Linux kernel.</p>
    <p>The first prototypes of Linux were publicly released later in 1991.  Version 1.0 was released on 14 March 1994.</p>
